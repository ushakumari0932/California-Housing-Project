# California-Housing-Project

Description:

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing information about housing in California. The dataset provides various features related to housing, including median income, housing median age, total bedrooms, median house values, ocean proximity, and more. Our goal is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into California's housing market. We will use Python and data visualization libraries to answer specific questions and provide explanations for our findings.

• Identified each features/columns in Dataset based on different categories: Nominal data, Ordinal data, Discrete data, Continuous data. • Performed Exploratory Data Analysis by using Python’s NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and seaborn libraries. • Leveraged User defined functions to handle certain columns where data segregation was required.
